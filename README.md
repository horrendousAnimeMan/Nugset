 Diophantine Equation using Python.
 
 This will return all possible combinations for Ax + By + Cz = D.
 A side effect of the hack used to determine valid combinations of Ax + By + Cz = D was that the runtime, for a moment, had an array of all combinations of a sequence of integers, e.g. 123, 231, 312, 213...
 This was used to make a prose-writing routine, where all combinations of a set of words were returned rather than simple integers.
 This was one of my first projects, and was a lot of fun to figure out.
