# Nugset
 Diophantine Equation using Python.
 
 A word about the title: The original problem this code was meant to solve was the question "how many 3-piece, 6-piece, and 9-piece McNuggets in a 1000-nugget order?  Or something along the lines of that.  But the equation is burned into my mind from weeks of learning what it was all about: Ax + By + Cz = D.
 
 Nugset69.py will return all possible combinations for Ax + By + Cz = D.
 A side effect of the hack used to determine valid combinations of Ax + By + Cz = D was that the runtime, for a moment, had an array of all combinations of a sequence of integers, e.g. 123, 231, 312, 213...
 This was used to make a prose-writing routine, wordJumble.py, where all combinations of a set of words were returned rather than simple integers.
 This was one of my first projects, and was a lot of fun to figure out.
